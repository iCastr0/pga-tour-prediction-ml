# PGA Tour Winner Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict winners of PGA Tour tournaments based on players' historical statistics.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Regularized Logistic Regression (GLMNET)
- Random Forest (tuned with hyperparameters)

## Results

| Model                          | Accuracy | AUC    |
|--------------------------------|----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression            | 0.9877   | 0.8872 |
| GLMNET                         | 0.9847   | 0.9819 |
| Random Forest (tuned)          | 0.9859   | 0.9858 |

## Requirements

- R
- Libraries: tidyverse, caret, glmnet, randomForest, pROC, etc.
